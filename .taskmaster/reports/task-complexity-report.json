		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Development Environment",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup process into subtasks such as: initializing the Node.js project, setting up Git version control, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and writing setup instructions in the README.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves several standard but essential steps for project initialization. While each step is straightforward, the combination requires attention to detail and clear documentation. The complexity is moderate due to the need for correct configuration and reproducibility."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core USDC Transfer Module",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: creating the donateUSDC.js module, connecting to the blockchain, loading signer from environment, implementing the transfer function, supporting multiple networks, adding gas estimation and fee optimization, and handling errors and transaction status.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires blockchain integration, secure key handling, multi-network support, and robust error handling. The logic is non-trivial and must be reliable, making it significantly more complex than basic setup tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Express.js API Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks such as: setting up the Express server, implementing the /api/donate endpoint, integrating the donateUSDC module, adding request validation, configuring CORS, and implementing rate limiting.",
			"reasoning": "Building an API endpoint with proper validation, security, and integration with the core module involves multiple concerns. Each aspect is manageable but together require careful coordination and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Security and Input Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: input validation, input sanitization, securing environment variables, implementing rate limiting, adding network connectivity checks, and ensuring sensitive data is not exposed.",
			"reasoning": "Security and validation are critical and must be comprehensive. This task spans multiple layers (API, environment, logging) and requires careful implementation to prevent vulnerabilities."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Error Handling and Status Reporting",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks such as: handling wallet balance errors, handling network errors, handling transaction failures, formatting error responses, and implementing secure error logging.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive error handling and clear status reporting are essential for reliability and user experience. This task requires anticipating various failure modes and ensuring no sensitive data is leaked."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Documentation and Setup Guide",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as: writing installation instructions, documenting configuration and environment variables, describing API usage and responses, and outlining security and deployment best practices.",
			"reasoning": "Documentation is straightforward but must be thorough and clear. The main challenge is ensuring completeness and accuracy for all project aspects."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Unit and Integration Testing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks such as: writing unit tests for donateUSDC.js, mocking wallet and contract interactions, writing integration tests for the API, testing mainnet and testnet scenarios, covering success and failure cases, and ensuring test coverage.",
			"reasoning": "Testing both blockchain interactions and API endpoints requires careful setup, mocking, and coverage of edge cases. Ensuring reliability across environments adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare for Deployment and Final Review",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks such as: code review, test review, documentation review, preparing deployment scripts, and conducting final end-to-end testing with real transactions.",
			"reasoning": "Final review and deployment preparation involve multiple checks but are procedural if previous tasks are complete. The main complexity is in thoroughness and ensuring nothing is missed before production."
